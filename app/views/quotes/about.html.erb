  Splurty was built by <a target="_blank" href="http://smithsaintil.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com">Smith Saintil</a> to inspire everyone's entrepreneural spirit. When we find ourselves at a crossroad in life, rather than defaulting to what's familiar, we need to ask ourselves "why not?" and take a step of faith. This Splurty web application is my "why not?" and through it, I want to encourage other people and provide a platform where they can inspire others as well.

    <p class="text-justify">
    Smith Saintil is an aspiring web developer who plans to utilize his skills to create a product and/or service that will empower other people. Growing up, Smith watched his parents, who immigrated from Haiti, work hard-and at times working two jobs-to help their children go as far as possible in life. Smith learned that the greatest joys in life come by creating a better world for someone else. And by means of his faith in Christ, Smith is compelled to steward the gifts he's been given. With the end destination in mind, Smith sees coding as the means to getting there.

    <p class="text-justify">
    When Smith is not coding, he enjoys spending quality time with his lovely wife, family, and friends. He likes to stay active, read, and looks for opportunities to pay it forward through service and mentoring.
