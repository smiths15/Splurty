Splurty is my first dynamic web application, where people can submit inspirational quotes. I built off the static page to include a navigation bar with links routing to another page and a modal form. Besides HTML and CSS, I coded with Ruby on Rails using Sublime as my text editor and Vagrant as my development environment.
